# Ayurvedic Plant Recognition using YoloV3 Model

This project revolves around the utilization of Ayurvedic plants for medicinal purposes. With numerous plants present in our surroundings, often with unknown uses and specifications, a Machine Learning (image recognition) model has been developed. This model can effectively detect and identify plants based on leaf images, subsequently providing relevant information about the identified plant.
